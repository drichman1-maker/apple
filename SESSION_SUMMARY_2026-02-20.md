## 💰 REVENUE POTENTIAL

**Conservative estimate (1,000 daily visitors):**
- 5% click affiliate links = 50 clicks/day
- 3% conversion = 1.5 sales/day
- $800 average order × 2% commission = $16/sale
- **$720/month potential**

**With price alerts driving engagement:**
- Higher repeat visits
- Email list for direct marketing
- **$1,000-2,000/month realistic**

## 🧠 RAY DALIO LESSON OF THE DAY

**"Pain + Reflection = Progress"**

Today we hit multiple roadblocks:
- Vercel deploy failed repeatedly (root directory issue)
- ESLint config errors
- Railway CLI login issues
- n8n deployment still pending

**The lesson:** Each failure taught us something. The Vercel issue revealed old Fly.io configs were conflicting. The ESLint error showed a wrong config reference. Railway's `--browserless` flag solved the auth issue.

**Dalio's principle:** Don't avoid pain. Embrace it, diagnose it, solve it. That's how systems get better. Your deployment pipeline is now cleaner than it was this morning because we fixed the root cause instead of band-aiding.

**Next week:** Apply this to marketing. Test, fail, reflect, improve. Price alerts that don't convert → diagnose why → iterate.
