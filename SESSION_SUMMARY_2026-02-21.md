## 💰 REVENUE TRACKING

Current: $0
Target End of March: $500/month

Path to revenue:
1. ✅ Affiliate links in backend
2. 🟡 n8n price alerts (in progress)
3. ⏳ Email subscriber growth
4. ⏳ Content marketing (SEO)

---

## 🧠 LESSON OF THE DAY

**"Build systems, not tasks."**

Instead of just migrating one project at a time, we built:
1. A dashboard to monitor ALL projects
2. A monitoring system to track deals across ALL categories
3. A migration guide to standardize the process

This creates leverage - each future aggregator takes less time because the infrastructure exists.
