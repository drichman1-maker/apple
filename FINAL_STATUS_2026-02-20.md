## 🧠 RAY DALIO LESSON

**"Pain + Reflection = Progress"**

Today's failures:
- Vercel deploy failed 4x → Fixed by deleting/re-importing
- n8n build failed → Will fix Saturday with logs
- Railway auth issues → Solved with --browserless

**Lesson:** Each failure is data. Fix the root cause, don't band-aid.

**Next week:** Apply to marketing. Test ad creative → If CTR < 2%, diagnose → Iterate.
